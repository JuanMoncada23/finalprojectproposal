		<h1>Deadline Web Service</h1>
		<h2>The RedDragons Team</h2>
		<h3>Latest Update</h3>
			<p>The front end of the WebApp can currently:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a list of tasks and their deadlines with countdown timer</li>
				<li>Expire tasks upon reaching the deadline</li>
				<li>Mark tasks as finished, halting the countdown</li>
				<li>Load tasks from local JSON objects</li>
				<li>Save tasks and user information persistently to the database</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The logic-tier of the WebApp can currently:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Receive requests from the front end and store received data on its behalf</li>
				<li>Run within a docker container</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The storage solution can currently:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Store data sent to it by the logic-tier</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>End-User Description</h3>
			<p>The application allows users to create and set timers for a list of tasks to be 
				completed by a certain time. The user receives periodic reminders in the browser 
				about active timers as well as &ldquo;constructive&rdquo; criticism regarding 
				how close their tasks come to expiring.</p>
		<h3>Priority Features</h3>
			<p>The features required to make Deadline Web Service usable are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create and edit a list of tasks and their deadlines</li>
				<li>Attach a countdown timer to each task</li>
				<li>Store tasks persistently for users</li>
				<li>Expire tasks once the deadline is passed, sounding an alarm to the user</li>
				<li>Provide periodic reminders about active tasks based on remaining time</li>
				<li>Provide motivation to complete tasks before the deadline</li>
				<li>Mark tasks as finished, halting the countdown</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Additional Desired Features</h3>
			<p>If there were extra time, we would like to add:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Daily emails to users about their active tasks</li>
				<li>Marking tasks with a higher or lower priority</li>
				<li>Presenting average time taken per task and tracking improvement</li>
				<li>Color-code tasks based upon remaining time</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
			<p>Building the priority features will require:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML for webpage content</li>
				<li>CSS for webpage styling</li>
				<li>JavaScript / React for webpage interactions</li>
				<li>Go for the logic tier</li>
				<li>A database storage solution (MongoDB Atlas) for persistent storage</li>
				<li>Microsoft Azure for app hosting and data storage</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Demonstrating Learning From the Class</h3>
			<h4>HTML / CSS</h4>
				<p>Deadline Web Service utilizes HTML to provide static content for the webpage
					the app is built in. It also uses CSS to style portions of the webpage and
					the React App. These aspects of the project demonstrate knowledge and skills
					gained during Sprint 5 (web development).</p>
			<h4>JavaScript / React</h4>
				<p>The core of the Deadline Web Service app is written in the JavaScript React 
					framework, in order to make the app highly interactive in the browser. This
					provides the functionality that allows users to interact with the app. It 
					also demonstrates knowledge and skills gained from Sprints 5 and 7 (web 
					development and React development).</p>
			<h4>Golang</h4>
				<p>The logic-tier of Deadline Web Service is written in Golang. It establishes a
					connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and exposes endpoint APIs that the
					WebApp uses to save and load data persistently for users. This expands upon
					the main activity of Sprint 4 (client-server interactions in Golang with 
					JSON).</p>
			<h4>Microsoft Azure / GitHub</h4>
				<p>Microsoft Azure is used to host the Deadline Web Service, a dockerized Go 
					logic-tier, and the MongoDB Atlas database. GitHub is used to host the
					source code and is linked to the Azure deployment to provide CI/CD to the
					WebApp. Using Azure and GitHub demonstrates knowledge from Sprints 4 through
					7 relating to Azure WebApp hosting, GitHub source code management, and 
					CI/CD best practices.</p>
		<h3>Demonstrating Learning From Outside the Class</h3>
			<h4>Using Asynchronous JavaScript Fetch Requests</h4>
				<p>Our time in class was more focused on single-page apps that did not have to 
					perform any requests to other resources in order to function. Deadline Web
					Services does need to do this. Specifically, the front end of the WebApp 
					(written in React) interacts with the storage solution (MongoDB Atlas) by 
					performing asynchronous JavaScript fetch requests to the logic-tier 
					(written in Golang), which performs the database query and returns some 
					data. As an additional challenge, the logic-tier implements this interaction
					by exposing RESTful endpoint APIs. This means that the front end needs to
					POST JSON data within the request, instead of a simple GET request. The 
					solution we implmented is to use JavaScript fetch() requests with the async /
					await syntax, which forces the WebApp to wait for the request to finish before
					continuing. This prevents data from being POSTed to the logic-tier out of 
					order, which would cause issues with the database queries.</p>
